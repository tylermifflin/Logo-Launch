## Description
Logo Launch was created to help the user quickly create a custome SVG file. The user can choose up to any 3 text characters and make the text any color they want. The user can then choose between using a cirlce, square, or triangle and make it any color they want. The app will then generate their custome SVG file. Here are screenshots of a custom SVG circle, square, and triangle :

## Contributing
I worked alone on this project, I am open to any contributions.
## Tests
I created tests in the shapes.test.js file that make sure the each shape will inherit the color from the class Shape constructor. There is a test for circle, square, and triangle. All the tests pass.
